About
=====

Flow is intended to fulfill three roles:

1) A lightweight streaming framework for data and objects.

2) A set of pre-made stream elements for various tasks, including network
   and file system interaction.

3) High-level API for easy-to-use network and file system access, hiding the
   complexity of the underlying stream model.

For details regarding hacking on Flow itself, see the HACKING file, which you
should have obtained along with this writ.

Availability
============

Flow is maintained in the GNOME CVS repository. It can be checked out with
the following command:
