Flow TODO
=========

List of things that remain to be done for 1.0 and future milestones.

Version 1.0
-----------

- Make FlowIPResolver use a specific callback per lookup again. Signals
  don't work when they can be dispatched in multiple threads and you don't
  know which request is "yours". [DONE]

- Make FlowIPService able to store a name and resolve itself. It must also
  be able to store multiple addresses, so can no longer derive from
  FlowIPAddr. [DONE]

- Fix code globally to not do FLOW_IP_ADDR (ip_service), but instead use
  flow_ip_service_find_address (). [DONE]

- Implement a name-looker-upper element. Problem is naming: We already
  have FlowIPResolver and it's not an element.

- Implement UDP connector and convenience bin. This depends on the
  name-looker-upper above to be able to lookup and set the remote IP
  service between packets.

- Hide flow_strerror ().

- Add certificate and crypto options handling to FlowTlsProtocol. Need to
  figure out what people commonly use. Cert Import/export formats are
  important, but don't go overboard. If there's an on-disk standard format
  that can be handled directly by GnuTLS, that's perfect.

- Make FlowTlsProtocol generate server key in a worker thread, avoiding
  blocking on CPU (usually 2 seconds on startup).
