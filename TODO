Flow TODO
=========

List of things that remain to be done for 1.0 and future milestones.

Version 1.0
-----------

- Add error propagation to FlowIPResolver and FlowIPService.

- Implement UDP connector and convenience bin. This depends on the
  name-looker-upper above to be able to lookup and set the remote IP
  service between packets.

- Hide flow_strerror ().

- Add certificate and crypto options handling to FlowTlsProtocol. Need to
  figure out what people commonly use. Cert Import/export formats are
  important, but don't go overboard. If there's an on-disk standard format
  that can be handled directly by GnuTLS, that's perfect.

- Make FlowTlsProtocol generate server key in a worker thread, avoiding
  blocking on CPU (usually 2 seconds on startup).

- Port the generic Unix code to FreeBSD, Darwin and Win32.
